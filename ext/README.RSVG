This is the a librsvg wrapper for PHP. It lets you render SVG images using
librsvg onto Cairo surfaces (to begin with) and then write those to PNG, PDF,
PS, or even SVG if you're a little mad.

Requires: 
* PHP 5.2.x or greater
* librsvg 1.14
* PECL/Cairo

I am aware that there aren't many tests for this extension, this is due to
being unable to handle the dependency on the PECL/Cairo extension in a clean
way in make test. This will hopefully be improved.
